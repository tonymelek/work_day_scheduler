# Work Day Scheduler
## Description
This is a simple Work Day Scheduler. The application uses localStorage to store the data the user enters. The application uses `moment.js` library for easier date and time access.

* The app renders the info. from localStorage everytime the page loads or user navigates between different days and populates them to the user so they can add or modify them.

* The app allows users to navigate in dates forwards and backwards, using arrows next to the displayed date.



## Features
* Start at current date
